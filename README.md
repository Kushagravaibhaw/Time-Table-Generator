# Time-Table-Generator
This java program generates time table based on certain rules.
Rules:
  A Teacher has a maximum of 2 lectures in a day,
  a Teacher can take a maximum of 1 lecture in a particular class in a day,
  a Teacher can take a maximum of 2 lectures in a particular class in a week,
  a Class has a maximum of 3 lectures in a day.
When the program starts to execute, it asks how many Rooms are available and their capacity. And asks the capacity of the Classes.
It checks that whether at a particular time slot a particular Teacher is free and a particular Class is free  and any room is available and if a room is available, would it have the capacity to fit the class in?
Considering all these checks and the above rule program generates a timetable . At the end, the program also displays the Classes that are unable to take all their lectures.
